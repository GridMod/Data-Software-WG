# Data-Software-WG
## *Grid Modernization Lab Consortium Planning and Design Tools Data and Software Working Group*

## Mission Statement
The mission of the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium (GMLC) Planning and Design Tools (PDT) Data and Software Working Group (DSWG) is to ensure that the developed datasets, methods, and software are useful, valid, and reasonably accessible.

## Scope
The objective of the GMLC Planning and Design Tools projects is to develop next-generation design and planning tools that leverage computational enhancements to improve grid reliability, resilience, and economic efficiency. Through the execution of PDT projects, several methods and software packages will be developed. Additionally, datasets that represent realistic systems will be used for software validation. The main objective of this working group is to foster collaboration through commonalities in data requirements and project objectives. 

This repository is intended to collect data and software descriptions for GMLC Planning and Design Tools projects.
