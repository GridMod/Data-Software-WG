# Approach

## Software
The Data and Software Working group has identified a need for commonsoftware release strategies across PDT projects. 
Project teams are encouraged to release the methods and software developed within Grid Modernization projects through open-source software licensing agreements. 
To ensure license compatabilty and open access, the [BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license will be applied to open-source software developed by the GMLC PDT projects.
Future working group activities will identify incentives for open-source softwared development in the GMLC.

## Data
The Data and Software Working group has identified a common approach to
managing data use across relevant PDT projects. 
The working group has identified several options for data access and formatting 
and some of the associated shortcomings. Due to the unique requirements of 
each PDT project, no acceptable common data fromat has been identified. 
Working group members have pledged to provide translations between adopted 
project data formats and MATPOWER (transmission) and OpenDSS (distribution) 
data formats. 

The research requirements
of the PDT projects necessitate the maintenance of up to three levels of
data access. First, the use of open-access datasets is required to
facilitate software development, benchmarking and validation, and
publication. Second, the use of Critical Energy Infrastructure Information
(CEII) protected data is required to represent many real systems in the
United States. Finally, some projects require data protected by
Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) due to business sensitive contents.

- Open datasets required by each project have been identified and are
being hosted on shared repositories. Opportunities to converge on common
datasets across relevant PDT (and other GMLC) projects have been
identified. For example, the RTS-GMLC test dataset for production cost
modeling is being used as a benchmark test case for 1.4.26, 1.4.18,
1.3.33, WGRID-35, and SI-1631.

  - Open datasets representing distribution systems have also been
identified and tailored for GMLC use.

- Each project team requiring access to CEII data has identified
strategies to ensure CEII compliance. Additionally, all project team
members requiring CEII access have applied for CEII approval.

- Each project team requiring NDA protected data has identified or
executed required NDAs.

The working group has identified the following outstanding issues:
 - IT support to host and manage data and software storage and access.
 - Identify common data formatting requirements.
 - Incentives and requirements to develop open data and software.
