# *Extreme Event Modeling (1.4.17)* Software 

The extreme event modeling project has deliverables associated with open source delivery of software tools.  The team has not yet adopted a strategy for delivering the software. Ideally, we'd like to be part of GMLC (or planning and design) wide solution to delivering software (GMLC github?) so that we don't have a lot of one offs.  

We are also cognizant of potential sensitivities in the software implementation of the capability that is developed. Prior to open source release, we expecet that the codes will need review for appropriate federal entities.
