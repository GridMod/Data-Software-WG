# Multi-Scale Production Cost Modeling (1.4.26) Data 
To accomplish the Multi-Scale Production Cost Modeling project objectives of improving deterministic and stochastic production cost models, we will benchmark developed approaches using testcases to generate problems of three different sizes. 
## Small System Benchmark
To benchmark relatively small problems, we will use the [RTS-GMLC](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC)

## Medium and Large System Benchmarks
The medium and large system benchmarks will be derived from the [ERGIS](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/ergis.html) dataset. The complete ERGIS dataset is available in a format compatable with the PLEXOS production cost model from [Energy Exemplar](http://energyexemplar.com/2016/08/energy-exemplar-and-nrel-present-the-ergis-dataset/). The medium and large system benchrmark cases will be derived from a geographical subset of the ERGIS dataset.
